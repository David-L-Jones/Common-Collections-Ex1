# Rust Common Collections - Exercise 1

In the book The Rust Programming Language by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols,
chapter 8 - Common Collections - presents 3 additional exercises. This is my
solution to exercise 1:

* Given a list of integers, use a vector and return the mean (the average value), 
median (when sorted, the value in the middle position), and mode (the value
that occurs the most often; a hash map will be helpful here) of the list.
